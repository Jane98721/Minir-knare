How to run this project on your computer!

Clone the project from Github or open the file if it was sent to you.

Open the terminal.

Write npm install and press enter to install the Node package manager.

Because we are using the framework "Express" you need to also install it by writing npm install express in the terminal and press enter.

I also installed cors by writing install cors and press enter.

If using VS code- To open the project click "Go live".

To open the server- Open the terminal and write "node app.js" and press enter.
